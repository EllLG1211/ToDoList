## Context
This was a 2-month university project conducted at Clermont's IT IUT, from November 2021 to January 2022. It was part of my second-year back-end web programming course.

The subject was : create a To-do list website. One can either connect to create their own lists or just add some as a visitor. User accounts are creatable. Lists can either be public or private (visitors cannot create private task lists). Anyone can add a task to a list, and complete tasks, as long as they are connected. A list can also be deleted by its creator.

This was proposed as a two-student group project, but I ended up coding it alone due to an odd number of students in the classroom.

## Miscellanious Info
* Languages used : php, html. One file (Views/view_task_list.html) contains css too.
* Project structure is a MVC
* Apache server and mysql server used with the help of XAMPP
* Export of database is available in Config/database.sql
* Controllers and model gateways use single responsibility principle; during evaluation my teacher did explain that was unusual in web programming
* Front controller pattern used
* Database connection through PDO
